Created for CUNY Hackathon Spring 2018.

For many New Yorkers in this day and age, citizens are always in a rush to get to their destination. Some drivers are reckless on the road and this affects everyone around them. Inspired by NYC's Vision 0 initiative to prevent motor collisions from happening, our web app helps drivers to be more cautious, especially in areas that are known to have many accidents.

Run instructions:
